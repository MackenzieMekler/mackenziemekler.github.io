                <p class="short-intro">Hey everyone! There is a whole page dedicated to this (see my "about me" for some
                    more fun) but I figured I would give a quick intro. My name is Mackenzie (Mack) Mekler and I am a
                    student. I mean this beyond my PhD studies - which I have only just begun - and more in that
                    learning is a huge part of who I am. It is my favorite past time and encompasses the sciences,
                    engineering, technology, language, sports, and so much more. Following a student I am a builder as
                    creating projects is my second favorite thing to do. This website is a reflection of these loves as
                    I taught myself the code required to make it and then built and hosted it myself. My career shows
                    this as well. As a scientific researcher I am paid to learn and to build things that have never been
                    learnt or built before. This is a dream to me and is part of why I think research called so strongly
                    to me.</p>
                <p class="short-intro">Beyond the lab I take up many hobbies. I enjoy language learning having studied
                    many before, French, Portuguese (Brazilian), Mandarin, and to the largest extent Spanish. I also am
                    a sports/games fanatic. I play soccer and volleyball most but can be caught playing pretty much any
                    sport. Additionally, some of my favorite activities with friends include board games like codenames,
                    taboo, hand-to-hand wombat, and exploding kittens.</p>

                            them to complete a project, here I want to acknowledge all of the incredible people that

                            helped me become the researcher I am today and who are helping me become the researcher I
