                        <p>So many times I have been asked "When did you 'get into' science?". There are moments in my
                            life
                            where I felt my love for the sciences grow. One that I frequently use to answer this in
                            applications
                            or conversation is stepping into my first lab in college. While this was a transformative
                            experience
                            for me the real moment is slightly more embarassing.</p>
                        <p>In my elementary school there was a pride award given to the student that performed the
                            highest
                            in a
                            certain exam for a specific subject. My 5th grade self wanted nothing more in the world than
                            to
                            win
                            the math pride award and be the best mathematician in the 5th grade. However, when the time
                            came, I
                            lost the math award but had somehow won the science? I at this time had no interest at all
                            in
                            the
                            sciences but something about this award made me consider it. Afterall I had a piece of paper
                            that
                            said I was good at it. As silly and somewhat conceited as this moment was, it was the first
                            time
                            my
                            life shifted towards research. Some picture evidence of this is shown to the left (I think
                            you
                            can still see the pain from losing math in my eyes a bit). </p>
                        <p>In middle school, I fell into science. Crash course chemistry, biology, and physics became
                            like
                            comfort shows to me and I could receite Hank Green's lines in those youtube videos. There
                            was
                            something addicting to me about learning how the world worked and the further into it I dove
                            the
                            more I realized I knew nothing and the more I wanted to know. I am happy to say that this
                            passion
                            continued through high school where I pursued the International Baccalaureate program to
                            have
                            access
                            to the higest level of math and science curriculum available. While I learned about my love
                            for
                            science in elementary school, it was in this IB program where I first discovered the power
                            of
                            our
                            immune systems and the devestation that they defend us from. </p>

                <h2>The University of Florida</h2>
                <div class="UF-stuff container">
                    <p>I graduated high school fully intent on using this love for science to study medicine and become
                        a
                        doctor. To reach this end I decided to attend the University of Florida (GO GATORS!) and be
                        pre-med.
                        Before my even my first class at UF, I stepped into a research lab as an undergraduate
                        researcher
                        and immediately knew that this was the career I wanted to pursue. Quickly the lab became a
                        primary
                        focus at UF and I worked in three of them over the 3 years that I was there. This allowed me to
                        build up a variety of skills and to see how science can be applied in fields from autoimmune
                        disorders, agriculture, pest control, and genetic disease. The more I learned from my time in
                        the
                        lab the more confident I became in my desire to be a researcher. It was the perfect place for
                        me, it
                        turned the passion for learning and discovery that fueled nights of crash course videos in
                        middle
                        school into a paying career. Being at such a large university also gave me access to explore
                        such a
                        wide variety of fields both in reserach and through classes. I began pusuing classes that would
                        shape me as a scientist. This included coding classes, machine learning, cancer biology,
                        epigenetics, and anything else that would open my eyes to different areas and tools to be used
                        in
                        scientific research.</p><img src="./images/grad-pic-me.jpg" alt="">

                    <div class="text">
                        <p>After 3 short years at UF, I graduated and was given a dream opportunity to continue my
                            studies at
                            Emory University as a part of their Cancer Biology Ph.D. program. In my first year, I
                            quickly
                            learned that the cancer and immunology that I knew and understood dwindled in the face of
                            what I was
                            going to learn. The first 2 semesters of classes opened my eyes to research fields I didn't
                            know
                            existed and I could truly feel myself on the cutting edge of science.</p>
                        <p>With the first year also came rotations. I was given the chance to rotate in three labs where
                            I
                            studied cancer immunology, immunometabolism, and the epigenetic regulation of breast cancer
                            markers.
                            I am lucky to say that these three lab experiences were all incredible each teaching me new
                            skills
                            but in the end I decided to continue my graduate studies by applying my interests in
                            immunology to
                            myeloma through research with Dr. Lawrence Boise.</p>
                        <p>And this brings us up to now, as a second year graduate student I have taken a project and am
                            continuing to develop new skills and make new connections in and out of my lab. If you want
                            to hear
                            more about the projects I am working on or have worked on in the past please click on my

                    <div class="text">
                        <p>Being a PhD student - while undoubtedly my "calling" - is still quite difficult sometimes.
                            This is
                            why I am so fortunate to have both so many friends and so many hobbies that keep me going in
                            and out
                            of the lab.</p>
                        <p>From as early as I found my love for science, I have always had a similar passion for sports.
                            I
                            played baseball and soccer from an early age and will play just about anything as long as I
                            have
                            people to play with. In college, I began playing volleyball as well and with it found a
                            group of
                            friends that have been a huge part of my life even today. This love for volleyball and
                            sports more
                            generally has kept with me even today. I am a member of Emory's club volleyball team and am
                            proud to
                            say that I have won intramural volleyball indoor and beach with a group of graduate students
                            in my
                            first year here (although I was advised to not put this award on my CV/Biosketch sadly).</p>
                        <p>When not playing sports, I can be found having game nights with friends (I am always happy to
                            take a
                            board game suggestion) where I play some of my favorite games like codenames, fishbowl, and
                            more!
                            Also I spend a lot of time taking on various projects. With learning, creating has always
                            been a
                            passion of mine and it has led me to chase hobbies such as coding (which I used to make this
                            website
                            from scratch), blogging (which you can find some of on here), and art as well which I have
                            used to
                            decorate my new apartment in Atlanta.</p>
